Description: Displays the number of iterations that have been performed, as well the number of iterations that are left to be performed. This can be used to monitor the progress of a series of iterations, for example when applying a function to each row in a data frame using the map group of functions within the purrr package. 
    The total number of iterations is calculated by passing in the data frame, vector or list to be used in the iteration.

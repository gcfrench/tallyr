Description: The main goal of tallyr is to provide a quick and easy way to monitor progress whilst iterating through a data frame, applying a function to each row at a time. 
    This can be useful when the time taken for this step is sufficiently long enough to run the script in the background, coming back to the console at regular intervals to check the progress. 
    To help with monitoring this progress, the number of rows remaining can be displayed in the console so that you can see at a glance how far the script has progressed and how far there is left to go.
